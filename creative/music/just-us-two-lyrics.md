## Verse 1
Late night conversations, no rush, no plans  
Just the sound of your voice, the touch of your hands  
City lights are fading, but we're glowing bright  
In this little world we made, everything feels right  

## Pre-Chorus
No need for the crowd, no need for the scene  
Just you and me, baby, living this dream  
When the world gets loud, we find our way through  
'Cause all I really need is just us two  

## Chorus
Just us two, nothing else matters  
Hearts aligned, no chains, no shatter  
In your eyes, I found my shelter  
Just us two, forever and ever  

Just us two, quiet love and laughter  
No noise, no chase, no disaster  
Safe in your arms, I'm home, I'm free  
Just us two, you and me  

## Verse 2
Morning light is creeping through the window pane  
Your smile's the only sunrise I wanna claim  
We don't need the world to validate our vibe  
In this sacred space, our love comes alive  

## Pre-Chorus
No need for the crowd, no need for the scene  
Just you and me, baby, living this dream  
When the world gets loud, we find our way through  
'Cause all I really need is just us two  

## Chorus
Just us two, nothing else matters  
Hearts aligned, no chains, no shatter  
In your eyes, I found my shelter  
Just us two, forever and ever  

Just us two, quiet love and laughter  
No noise, no chase, no disaster  
Safe in your arms, I'm home, I'm free  
Just us two, you and me  

## Bridge
They can keep their spotlight, their stage, their fame  
We got something real that they can't name  
Simple. Honest. Unshakable truth  
All I'll ever need is me and you  

(Instrumental break - smooth Rhodes keys and soft bass)

In the stillness, we found our song  
Right here's where we both belong  

## Final Chorus
Just us two, nothing else matters  
Hearts aligned, no chains, no shatter  
In your eyes, I found my shelter  
Just us two, forever and ever  

Just us two, quiet love and laughter  
No noise, no chase, no disaster  
Safe in your arms, I'm home, I'm free  
Just us two, you and me  

## Outro
Mmm, just us two  
Baby, me and you  
Just us two  
Forever true  
(fade out)
