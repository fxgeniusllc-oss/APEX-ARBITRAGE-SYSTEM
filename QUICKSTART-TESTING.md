## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Tests Take Too Long
```bash
# Tests should complete in under 1 second
# If they take longer, check system resources
yarn test
# Expected: ~680ms
```

### Rust Build Fails
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cd src/rust
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```

### Tests Fail
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
yarn test -- --reporter=spec

# Check specific test file
node --test tests/comprehensive-rust-tests.test.js
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

All tests should show:

```
✅ 44/44 tests passing
✅ 0 failures
✅ Duration < 1 second
✅ All performance benchmarks exceeded
✅ 100% success rate
```
