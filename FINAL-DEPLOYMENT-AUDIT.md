## 💡 Recommendations

1. Always use a dedicated wallet for trading operations
2. Start with small amounts in DEV mode before LIVE deployment
3. Set up monitoring alerts (Telegram/email) for all operations
4. Run benchmarks: yarn run validate:performance
5. Build Rust engine for maximum performance: yarn run build:rust
6. Run pre-operation checklist: yarn run precheck
7. Run full validation: yarn run validate
8. Run regression tests: yarn run test:regression
9. Test in DEV mode thoroughly before switching to LIVE
10. Set up monitoring and logging before production deployment
11. Prepare rollback plan in case of issues

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Requirements

- [ ] RPC endpoints configured for all chains
- [ ] Private key configured (for LIVE mode)
- [ ] Sufficient gas tokens on all active chains
- [ ] Safety parameters configured (profit, gas, loss limits)
- [ ] Emergency stop mechanism tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Telegram notifications configured
- [ ] System tested in DEV mode
- [ ] Pre-operation checklist passed (`yarn run precheck`)
- [ ] Backup and recovery plan in place

### Validation Steps

```bash
# Run pre-operation checklist
yarn run precheck

# Run comprehensive validation
yarn run validate

# Run performance validation
yarn run validate:performance

# Run regression tests
yarn run test:regression
```

### Post-Deployment Actions

1. Monitor system closely for first 24 hours
2. Check logs regularly for errors or warnings
3. Verify actual transactions on block explorer
4. Track profitability and success rate metrics
5. Adjust parameters based on performance data
