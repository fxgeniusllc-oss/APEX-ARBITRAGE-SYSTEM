For each opportunity:
- Simulates complete swap path
- Calculates gross profit
- Subtracts gas costs
- Validates against minimum profit threshold

### 3. **Flash Loan Execution**
When profitable opportunity found:
- Borrows tokens from Balancer (zero fee)
- Executes multi-hop swaps across DEXes
- Repays loan + keeps profit
- All in single atomic transaction

### 4. **Safety Validation**
Before execution:
- Checks gas price limits
- Validates daily loss limits
- Confirms rate limits
- Verifies no emergency stop

## 🔧 Configuration

### Execution Modes

The APEX system now supports three execution modes:

```bash
# MODE options: LIVE, DEV, SIM
MODE=DEV

# 🔴 LIVE MODE
#    - Executes real arbitrage transactions on-chain
#    - Uses real funds - PRODUCTION ONLY
#    - All safety checks enforced

# 🟡 DEV MODE (DEFAULT)
#    - Collects and analyzes real live DEX data
#    - Simulates all transactions (dry-run)
#    - No on-chain execution - SAFE FOR TESTING
#    - Perfect for strategy validation

# 🔵 SIM MODE
#    - Simulation and backtesting mode
#    - Uses real market data
#    - Can incorporate historical data
#    - For strategy development and analysis
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Always test in DEV or SIM mode first. Only switch to LIVE mode after thorough testing and validation.

### Environment Variables (.env)

### Smart Contract Configuration

The deployed contract has adjustable parameters:

```solidity
// Update minimum profit threshold
contract.setMinProfitBps(10); // 0.1%

// Update maximum gas price
contract.setMaxGasPrice(100); // 100 Gwei

// Withdraw accumulated profits
contract.withdrawProfits(tokenAddress, yourAddress);
```

```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Transaction Reverted"

**Causes:**
- Price moved before execution
- Insufficient liquidity
- Slippage exceeded

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Increase slippage tolerance
SLIPPAGE_BPS=100  # 1% instead of 0.5%

# Increase minimum profit (reduces false positives)
MIN_PROFIT_USD=10

# Reduce scan interval (faster execution)
SCAN_INTERVAL=30000  # 30 seconds
```

### Issue: "Gas Price Too High"

**Cause:** Network congestion

**Solution:**
```bash
# Increase max gas price (if profitable)
MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=150

# Or wait for gas to drop (bot will auto-resume)
```

### Issue: "No Profitable Opportunities"

**Causes:**
- Low market volatility
- High gas prices
- Tight profit threshold

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Lower profit threshold (use with caution)
MIN_PROFIT_USD=3

# Increase test amounts (larger trades = larger profits)
# Edit ROUTES array in production-runner.js
const testAmounts = [500, 1000, 2000, 5000];
```

### Issue: "Insufficient MATIC Balance"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check balance
yarn verify

# Send MATIC to your wallet address
# Recommended: 10 MATIC for sustained operations
```

---

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Routes

Add your own arbitrage routes:

```javascript
// In apex-production-runner.js
const ROUTES = [
  // ... existing routes
  {
    id: 'custom_route_1',
    path: ['TOKEN_A', 'TOKEN_B', 'TOKEN_C', 'TOKEN_A'],
    dexes: ['quickswap', 'sushiswap', 'uniswap_v3'],
    description: 'Your custom route',
    gasEstimate: 500000,
    priority: 2
  }
];
```

### 2. Dynamic Optimization

The system learns from execution history:

```javascript
const { optimizeRoutes } = require('./utils/optimizer');

// Routes automatically ranked by:
// - Historical success rate
// - Average profitability
// - Recent performance
const optimized = await optimizeRoutes(ROUTES);
```

### 3. Multi-Chain Expansion

Deploy to other chains:

```javascript
// In hardhat.config.js
networks: {
  polygon: { ... },
  arbitrum: {
    url: process.env.ARBITRUM_RPC,
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    chainId: 42161
  },
  optimism: {
    url: process.env.OPTIMISM_RPC,
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    chainId: 10
  }
}
```

### 4. Mempool Monitoring (Advanced)

Monitor pending transactions for faster execution:

```javascript
const provider = new ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider(CONFIG.RPC_WSS);

provider.on('pending', async (txHash) => {
  const tx = await provider.getTransaction(txHash);
  // Analyze pending transaction
  // Front-run if profitable (use with caution - MEV territory)
});
```

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
- Begin with minimum profit threshold of $5-10
- Run for 24 hours monitoring closely
- Gradually increase capital allocation

### 2. Optimize Gas Usage
- Trade during low gas periods (late night UTC)
- Use gas price monitoring
- Consider EIP-1559 (set maxPriorityFeePerGas)

### 3. Diversify Routes
- Don't rely on single route
- Test multiple DEX combinations
- Monitor route performance

### 4. Security First
- NEVER commit .env file
- Use hardware wallet for large amounts
- Regular security audits
- Keep dependencies updated

### 5. Monitor Closely
- Check dashboard regularly
- Set up Telegram alerts
- Review logs daily
- Track profitability trends

- **Data**: Uses real-time DEX data
- **Risk**: ZERO - No on-chain execution
- **Use When**: Testing new strategies, validating changes

#### 🔵 SIM Mode
- **Purpose**: Backtesting and simulation
- **Behavior**: Simulates transactions with historical/real data
- **Data**: Can use real-time or historical data
- **Risk**: ZERO - No on-chain execution
- **Use When**: Strategy development, performance analysis

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Set in .env file
MODE=DEV  # Options: LIVE, DEV, SIM
```

### Flashloan Integration

// Send with MEV protection
await gateway.sendTransaction(signedTx, 'polygon', {
    frontRunningProtection: true,
    nextValidator: true
});
