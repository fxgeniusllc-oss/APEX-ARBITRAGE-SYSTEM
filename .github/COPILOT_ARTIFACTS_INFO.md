# GitHub Copilot Artifact Upload Information

## About the "No files were found" Warning

When running GitHub Copilot coding agent workflows, you may see the following warning:

```
No files were found with the provided path: /home/runner/work/_temp/runtime-logs/blocked.jsonl
/home/runner/work/_temp/runtime-logs/blocked.md. No artifacts will be uploaded.
```

### This is Expected Behavior

This warning is **informational only** and does **not** indicate a problem. Here's why:

- The Copilot agent workflow attempts to upload `blocked.jsonl` and `blocked.md` files as artifacts after each run
- These files contain logs of URLs that were blocked by GitHub's firewall during the agent's execution
- **The files are only created when actual firewall blocks occur**
- If no URLs are blocked during a run (which is the normal case), these files don't exist
- The `actions/upload-artifact` action shows a warning when the specified files are not found

### What It Means

- ✅ **No firewall blocks occurred** during the Copilot agent's execution
- ✅ **The workflow completed successfully** despite the warning
- ✅ **No action is required** from repository maintainers

### When to Be Concerned

You should only investigate if:
- The Copilot agent is unable to access resources it needs (e.g., package registries, APIs)
- The agent reports actual failures related to network access
- You see actual error messages (not just this warning) about blocked URLs

### Technical Details

The Copilot agent workflow uses `actions/upload-artifact@v4` with the default setting of `if-no-files-found: warn`, which causes this informational message. Since this is a GitHub-managed workflow, it cannot be customized at the repository level.
