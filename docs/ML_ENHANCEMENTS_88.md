# ML Enhancements: 88+ Threshold & Advanced Models

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced ML capabilities implemented in the APEX Arbitrage System, including:

1. **Increased Score Threshold (88%+)**
2. **Ensemble ML Models (XGBoost + ONNX + LSTM)**
3. **Dynamic Thresholding Based on Market Conditions**
4. **Continuous Learning from Live Execution Results**
5. **Advanced Neural Network Risk Models**

## 1. Increased Score Threshold (88%+)

### Rationale
The threshold has been increased from 80% to **88%** to achieve a more selective execution rate of approximately 0.1-0.6% of opportunities, focusing only on the highest-quality trades.

### Implementation
```python
# Default threshold in orchestrator.py
confidence_threshold: float = 0.88

# Environment variable
ML_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.88
AI_THRESHOLD=0.88
```

### Expected Outcomes
- **Higher Precision**: Only execute trades with 88%+ confidence
- **Lower False Positives**: Reduced risk of unprofitable trades
- **Better Risk Management**: More conservative approach suitable for production
- **Execution Rate**: Approximately 0.1-0.6% of scanned opportunities

### Comparison

| Threshold | Execution Rate | Risk Level | Profit Quality |
|-----------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| 80%       | ~1-3%         | Medium     | Good           |
| **88%**   | **0.1-0.6%**  | **Low**    | **Excellent**  |

## 2. Ensemble ML Models (XGBoost + ONNX + LSTM)

### Architecture

The system now uses a **triple-model ensemble**:

1. **XGBoost** (40% weight)
   - Tree-based gradient boosting
   - High accuracy for tabular data
   - Feature importance analysis

2. **ONNX** (30% weight)
   - Optimized inference engine
   - GPU acceleration support
   - Cross-platform compatibility

3. **LSTM** (30% weight) - **NEW**
   - Recurrent neural network
   - Captures temporal patterns
   - Market dynamics modeling

### Ensemble Voting Strategy

```python
ensemble_weights = (0.4, 0.3, 0.3)  # XGBoost, ONNX, LSTM

# Weighted voting
ensemble_score = (
    0.4 * xgboost_score +
    0.3 * onnx_score +
    0.3 * lstm_score
)
```

### LSTM Model Architecture

```python
class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=10, hidden_size=128, output_size=1, num_layers=2):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, 
                           batch_first=True, dropout=0.2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, output_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
```

**Key Features:**
- 2-layer LSTM with 128 hidden units
- Dropout for regularization (0.2)
- Fully connected layers for output
- Sigmoid activation for probability output

## 3. Dynamic Thresholding Based on Market Conditions

### Market Condition Analyzer

The system now adjusts thresholds dynamically based on:

1. **Market Volatility**
   - High volatility → Higher threshold (more conservative)
   - Low volatility → Baseline threshold (more opportunities)

2. **Historical Success Rate**
   - Low success rate → Higher threshold (reduce losses)
   - High success rate → Lower threshold (capture more opportunities)

### Formula

```python
dynamic_threshold = base_threshold + volatility_adjustment + success_adjustment

# Volatility adjustment: ±0.05 max
volatility_adjustment = (avg_volatility - 0.5) * 0.1

# Success rate adjustment: ±0.025 max
success_adjustment = (0.5 - success_rate) * 0.05

# Clamped to range [0.88, 0.95]
final_threshold = max(0.88, min(0.95, dynamic_threshold))
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Enable dynamic thresholding
ENABLE_DYNAMIC_THRESHOLD=true

# Threshold bounds
MIN_THRESHOLD=0.88
MAX_THRESHOLD=0.95

# Volatility adjustment
THRESHOLD_VOLATILITY_ADJUSTMENT=true
```

### Example Scenarios

| Market Condition | Base | Volatility Adj | Success Adj | Final Threshold |
|------------------|------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Stable, High Success | 0.88 | -0.02 | -0.015 | **0.88** (clamped) |
| Volatile, Medium Success | 0.88 | +0.03 | +0.00 | **0.91** |
| Very Volatile, Low Success | 0.88 | +0.05 | +0.025 | **0.95** (clamped) |

## 4. Continuous Learning from Live Execution Results

### Learning Buffer

The system maintains a rolling buffer of execution results:

```python
learning_buffer = []  # Max size: 1000 samples

# Each execution logs:
{
    'features': [10 feature values],
    'label': 1 or 0 (success/failure),
    'expected_profit': float,
    'actual_profit': float,
    'timestamp': ISO 8601 string
}
```

### Execution Logging

Every trade execution is logged with:
- Feature vector used for prediction
- Binary outcome (success/failure)
- Expected vs. actual profit
- Timestamp

### Data Persistence

```python
# Auto-save every 100 iterations
ml_ensemble.save_learning_data('data/learning_buffer.json')
```

### Retraining Pipeline

The accumulated data can be used to:
1. Retrain models with real execution data
2. Adjust model weights based on performance
3. Identify model drift
4. Improve prediction accuracy over time

### Metrics Tracked

```python
execution_metrics = {
    'total_executions': int,
    'success_rate': float,
    'avg_profit': float,
    'profit_accuracy': float  # actual/expected ratio
}
```

## 5. Advanced Neural Network Risk Models

### Risk Assessment Components

1. **Multi-Model Consensus**
   - All three models must agree for high-risk trades
   - Reduces false positives
   - Conservative approach for large positions

2. **Profit-to-Risk Ratio**
   ```python
   risk_score = profit_usd / (gas_cost * 1.5)
   # Only execute if risk_score > 1.0
   ```

3. **Market Volatility Consideration**
   - Adjust threshold based on recent volatility
   - Higher threshold in volatile markets

4. **Historical Performance**
   - Track per-route success rates
   - Adjust confidence based on historical data

### Risk Levels

| Confidence | Risk Level | Action |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| < 88% | High Risk | Reject |
| 88-91% | Medium Risk | Execute with caution |
| 91-94% | Low Risk | Execute normally |
| 94%+ | Very Low Risk | Priority execution |

from orchestrator import ApexOrchestrator, Opportunity, ChainType

async def main():
    # Initialize orchestrator
    orchestrator = ApexOrchestrator()
    orchestrator.initialize()
    
    # Run main loop
    await orchestrator.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Manual Prediction

```python
from orchestrator import MLEnsemble, Opportunity, ChainType

# Create opportunity
opportunity = Opportunity(
    route_id="route_1",
    tokens=["USDC", "USDT", "USDC"],
    dexes=["quickswap", "sushiswap"],
    input_amount=1000.0,
    expected_output=1015.0,
    gas_estimate=350000,
    profit_usd=12.0,
    confidence_score=0.85,
    timestamp=int(time.time()),
    chain=ChainType.POLYGON
)

# Get prediction
ml_ensemble = MLEnsemble()
ml_ensemble.load_models(
    xgb_path="data/models/xgboost_model.json",
    onnx_path="data/models/onnx_model.onnx",
    lstm_path="data/models/lstm_model.pt"
)

score = ml_ensemble.predict(opportunity)
should_execute = ml_ensemble.should_execute(opportunity)

print(f"Prediction Score: {score:.3f}")
print(f"Should Execute: {should_execute}")
```

### Continuous Learning

```python
# After execution
actual_profit = 11.5  # Actual profit realized
success = True  # Trade was successful

# Log result
ml_ensemble.log_execution_result(opportunity, success, actual_profit)

# Get learning data
learning_data = ml_ensemble.get_learning_data()
print(f"Samples collected: {learning_data['count']}")
print(f"Success rate: {learning_data['success_rate']:.2%}")

# Save for retraining
ml_ensemble.save_learning_data()
```

   print(f"Samples: {learning_data['count']}")
   print(f"Success rate: {learning_data['success_rate']:.2%}")
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### LSTM Model Not Loading

If you see: `⚠️ PyTorch not available`

```bash
# Install PyTorch
pip install torch>=2.0.0

# Or for GPU support
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Low Execution Rate

If execution rate is too low:

1. Check dynamic threshold
2. Adjust MIN_THRESHOLD in .env
3. Review market conditions
4. Check model performance

### High False Positive Rate

If too many failed executions:

1. Increase MIN_THRESHOLD
2. Enable unanimous voting
3. Review feature engineering
4. Retrain models with recent data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Transformer Models**: Add attention-based models for better pattern recognition
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: RL agent for optimal threshold selection
3. **Multi-Task Learning**: Predict both profitability and execution success
4. **AutoML**: Automatic hyperparameter tuning
5. **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving model updates across multiple instances
