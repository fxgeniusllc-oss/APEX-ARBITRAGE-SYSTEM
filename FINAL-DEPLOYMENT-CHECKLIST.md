## 🛑 Emergency Procedures

### If Issues Occur

1. **Stop the system immediately**
   ```bash
   # Create emergency stop file
   touch EMERGENCY_STOP
   
   # Or press Ctrl+C
   ```

2. **Review logs**
   ```bash
   tail -100 logs/system.log
   npm run logs
   ```

3. **Check system status**
   ```bash
   npm run precheck
   npm run verify
   ```

4. **Investigate and fix**
   - Review error messages
   - Check configuration
   - Verify gas balances
   - Test RPC connections
   - Consult troubleshooting guide

5. **Test in DEV mode**
   ```bash
   # Set MODE=DEV in .env
   npm start
   # Verify issue is resolved
   ```

6. **Resume if safe**
   ```bash
   # Remove emergency stop
   rm EMERGENCY_STOP
   
   # Set MODE=LIVE in .env
   npm start
   ```
